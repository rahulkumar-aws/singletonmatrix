# Designing Your Own Firewall: Concepts and Implementation

A firewall is a crucial component in any network security architecture. While off-the-shelf solutions are widely available, there may be scenarios where designing a custom firewall is necessaryâ€”whether for specialized applications, unique traffic filtering needs, or educational purposes. This blog provides a comprehensive overview of how to design and implement your own firewall.

---

## Key Components of a Custom Firewall

1. **Packet Inspection Engine**:
   - The core of the firewall, responsible for analyzing incoming and outgoing packets.
   - Determines whether packets should be allowed, blocked, or modified based on predefined rules.

2. **Rule Management System**:
   - Stores filtering rules (e.g., allow or block based on IP, port, or protocol).
   - Allows administrators to add, modify, or delete rules dynamically.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Tracks all traffic decisions (e.g., packets allowed or blocked).
   - Provides insights into network activity and potential threats.

4. **User Interface**:
   - A dashboard for administrators to configure rules and monitor real-time traffic.

---

## System Design Architecture

1. **Traffic Interception**:
   - Intercepts all incoming and outgoing traffic using tools like raw sockets or packet capture libraries.

2. **Packet Filtering**:
   - Analyzes packet headers (e.g., IP, TCP/UDP) and payloads.
   - Matches packets against rules stored in the rule management system.

3. **Rule Enforcement**:
   - Blocks, forwards, or modifies packets based on rule matches.

4. **Action Logging**:
   - Logs decisions for compliance, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes.

---

## Implementation Steps

### **1. Packet Sniffing**

Capture network packets using libraries like `pcap` or tools like `scapy`.

#### Python Example Using Scapy:

```python
from scapy.all import sniff

# Function to handle packets
def process_packet(packet):
    print(packet.summary())

# Capture packets
sniff(filter="tcp", prn=process_packet)
```

---

### **2. Rule Management**

Define and manage rules for filtering traffic. Each rule should specify criteria (e.g., source IP, destination IP, port, protocol) and an action (allow or block).

#### Example Rule Definition:

```python
rules = [
    {"src_ip": "192.168.1.10", "port": 80, "action": "block"},
    {"src_ip": "0.0.0.0/0", "port": 443, "action": "allow"}
]
```

#### Packet Matching Function:

```python
def match_rule(packet, rules):
    for rule in rules:
        if packet["IP"].src == rule["src_ip"] and packet["TCP"].dport == rule["port"]:
            return rule["action"]
    return "allow"  # Default action
```

---

### **3. Packet Blocking and Forwarding**

- **Blocking Packets**:
   - Intercept packets and prevent them from being processed further by the operating system.
- **Forwarding Packets**:
   - Allow packets to pass through the firewall after validation.

#### Example Blocking Logic:

```python
def block_packet(packet):
    print(f"Blocked packet: {packet.summary()}")
```

---

### **4. Logging and Monitoring**

Track all packet decisions for auditing and analysis.

#### Logging Example:

```python
with open("firewall.log", "a") as log_file:
    log_file.write(f"{packet.summary()}
")
```

---

## Enhancements

1. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**:
   - Add functionality to detect suspicious patterns or anomalies in network traffic.

2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Extend functionality to inspect and filter HTTP traffic for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

3. **Scalability**:
   - Use distributed systems to handle high traffic volumes.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### **On-Premises Deployment**

1. Install the firewall on a dedicated hardware appliance or server.
2. Configure network routing to pass all traffic through the firewall.

### **Cloud Deployment**

1. Deploy the firewall as a virtual appliance in the cloud.
2. Integrate with cloud-native networking services (e.g., AWS VPC, Azure VNet).
3. Use APIs for dynamic rule updates.

---

## Example: Cloud-Based Firewall Deployment

### AWS Example Using EC2 Instance:

1. Launch an EC2 instance to run the custom firewall.
2. Configure the instance as a gateway for your VPC.
3. Use AWS Security Groups to control access to the instance.

#### Example Terraform Configuration for AWS:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "firewall" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "CustomFirewall"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "firewall_sg" {
  name = "firewall-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### Azure Example Using Virtual Machine:

1. Launch a Virtual Machine in Azure to host the custom firewall.
2. Assign a Network Security Group (NSG) to the VM.
3. Configure inbound and outbound rules in the NSG.

#### Example Terraform Configuration for Azure:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "firewall-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "firewall-rg"
}

resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "firewall_nsg" {
  name                = "firewall-nsg"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "firewall-rg"

  security_rule {
    name                       = "Allow-SSH"
    priority                   = 100
    direction                  = "Inbound"
    access                     = "Allow"
    protocol                   = "Tcp"
    source_port_range          = "*"
    destination_port_range     = "22"
    source_address_prefix      = "*"
    destination_address_prefix = "*"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "firewall_nic" {
  name                = "firewall-nic"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "firewall-rg"
  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "internal"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "firewall_vm" {
  name                = "firewall-vm"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "firewall-rg"
  size                = "Standard_B1ms"
  admin_username      = "adminuser"
  admin_password      = "Password1234!"

  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.firewall_nic.id]

  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  source_image_reference {
    publisher = "Canonical"
    offer     = "UbuntuServer"
    sku       = "18.04-LTS"
    version   = "latest"
  }
}
```
